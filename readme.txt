This plugin helps you integrate your wordpress site in the [3waylinks.net](http://www.seo-traffic-guide.de/recommends/3waylinks "3waylinks.net") backlink buidling system

== Description ==

[3waylinks.net](http://www.seo-traffic-guide.de/recommends/3waylinks "3waylinks.net") by Jon Leger 
is an excellent link building system - there is no easier way to build "one way" backlinks - only that up to now 
getting it running with wordpress could sometimes be a little bit difficult... This plugin makes the process of putting 
a new wordpress site in the 3Waylinks system a lot easier.

Please note that you have to be a member of [3waylinks.net](http://www.seo-traffic-guide.de/recommends/3waylinks "3waylinks.net") in order to be able to use it!

== Installation ==

1. unzip threewl-php-page.zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate the plugin
2. Follow the installation instructions on the [plugin homepage] (http://www.seo-traffic-guide.de/3waylinks-installation-instructions/ "Installation instructions")
 
This is how it works in short words...
After enabling this plugin, go to the plugin options page and create a static page 
that can display the 3WL links. You can use the "Create Page" button on the plugin
options page to do it for you.
If you want to add the code to an existing page, embed this comment:

  <!-- threewl_php_page -->
  
When the page is displayed, the 3WL PHP code is generated and
your 3WL Links are displayed in place of the comment.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin, now how do I get backlinks? =

You need to be a member of the [3waylinks.net](http://www.seo-traffic-guide.de/recommends/3waylinks "3waylinks.net") network in order to receive links 

= Where can I find my 3WL ID for an existing site? =

Log in to your 3WL backend, click on "my domains" then click on edit behind the domain you need the ID for.
Now if you have a look on the URL line in your browser it should look like http://3waylinks.net/index.php?action=domain&id=XXXXX
Where XXXXX is your 3WL ID for that particular domain
